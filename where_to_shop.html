   	<h2>Where to Shop</h2>
    <p> The Department of Homeland Security intercepted more than 26,000 shipments of fake goods worth more than $1.3 billion across American borders during Fiscal Year 2020. 
	The IACC helps law enforcement organizations by offering training courses that teach officers about trends in counterfeiting and how to spot fake goods. By being savvy shoppers and making informed decisions
	on where to get genuine goods and steer clear of counterfeits, retail buyers and consumers may also assist to reduce the sale of counterfeit products. 
	A PRICE that seems too good to be true probably is.
Packaging: The likelihood of a product being counterfeit increases if it is being sold without its packaging, if it looks shoddy, or if it contains printing flaws (such as fuzzy images, typos, spelling, or grammatical issues).
Consider the location where the product is sold:

In-Store: Consider whether you would generally anticipate finding the product being offered in this setting. Deal only with reputable, long-standing vendors.
Online: Don't be duped by a website that appears to be professionally designed; counterfeiters sometimes copy images and formatting from genuine websites to make their webpages appear legitimate. Examine the tiny print on the FAQs, "Contact Us" websites, product descriptions, and on their social channels.</p>
