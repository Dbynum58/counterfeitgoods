   	<h2>StockX</h2>
    <p>StockX is a marketplace where Buyers and Sellers may submit anonymous offers for a range of shoes, streetwear, gadgets, and collectibles. The offers are based on the item's current site worth as well as the price you're ready to pay for it or sell it for. The anonymous nature of StockX attempts to simplify the buying and selling process: Buyers view the lowest available sale price, and Sellers view the highest purchasing offer.A transaction on StockX doesn't start until a Seller and a Buyer agree on a price through a Buyer's Bid matching a Seller's Ask, or vice versa, because both Buyers and Sellers can establish their respective offers.


On StockX, there are two ways for a Buyer to find a Seller to match with by using the “Buy Now” and “Bid” features.
Whether you like it or not, fake products are an issue for secondary market current cultural commodities. Both the quantity and quality of unlicensed commodities have risen (often made in the same factory as the real items).

StockX has always been dedicated to preventing fraud and counterfeiting on our marketplace. We continue to be one of the only marketplaces dedicated to physically inspecting every item that uses our site.

Over 1.4 million goods worth more than $400 million have been rejected as a result of our efforts.

StockX will keep making investments in people, systems, and technology to stay one step ahead of fraudsters and enhance our consumers' purchasing experiences.
