   	<h2>Grailed</h2>
    <p>Grailed is a high-end online retailer of clothing for men that focuses on high-end footwear, designer clothing, and streetwear. The service, which was established in 2013 by Arun Gupta and Alex Brown, has more than 5 million users who buy and sell clothing. By 2021, Grailed will have roughly 7 million users and about 3 million apparel products listed on its marketplace.
This is a refuge for resellers of limited-edition footwear and collaborations. Sellers have the option of listing an item for sale or opening bids on trendy or expensive goods. Selling on Grailed incurs expenses, but purchasing is cost-free.
 Grailed uses a rigorous digital verification procedure since it's crucial for customers to feel confident in the merchant they're purchasing from. Grailed's crew is skilled in identifying an item's qualities, including tags, logo size and form, embroidery, and workmanship, in order to identify fake and inauthentic products.

Before coming online, high-risk products like Supreme, Jordan, and upscale men's clothes must all undergo digital verification to assure customer safety and the elimination of counterfeit goods. Moderators will permanently freeze the account of any seller detected trying to sell fake goods and enforce a zero-tolerance policy. Although it may sound harsh, this regulation helps Grailed keep con artists away, making the buying process simpler for customers.</p>
